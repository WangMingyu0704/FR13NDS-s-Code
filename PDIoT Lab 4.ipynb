Each window contains a sequence of sensor measurements that represent a short period of time, and this segmented data is used to extract features or make predictions about the activity happening within that window.\n","\n","### Key Concepts of a Sliding Window\n","1.   **Window Size:** This refers to the length of each segment or window, typically defined in terms of the number of time steps or the duration (e.g., 2 seconds). The window size should be chosen carefully to capture enough information about the activity without making the window too large.\n","2.   **Step Size:** The step size determines how far the window moves forward after each step. If the step size is smaller than the window size, the windows will overlap. For example, if the window size is 5 seconds and the step size is 2 seconds, there will be a 3-second overlap between consecutive windows. Overlapping windows provide more data for analysis and can help smooth out predictions by capturing transitional activities.\n","3.   **Non-Overlapping Windows:** If the step size is equal to the window size, the windows do not overlap. This method provides distinct segments of data but may miss transitional phases between activities.\n","\n","### Why Sliding Windows for Activity Recognition?\n","\n","* Segmentation of Continuous Data: Activity recognition systems work with continuous streams of sensor data, and the sliding window helps segment these into manageable pieces to classify activities within specific intervals.\n","\n","* Context Capturing: Human activities are often complex and spread across time. By using a sliding window, you can capture context across a short duration, which may include transitions or small fluctuations in the activity (e.g., a person moving from sitting to standing).\n","\n","* Feature Extraction: Within each window, features such as mean, variance, frequency domain features, etc., can be extracted to help classify the activity.\n","\n","* Real-Time Recognition: In real-time systems, the sliding window allows for continuous monitoring and updating of predictions as new data arrives.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"_J7-zQgZzP19"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def load_and_apply_sliding_windows(file_paths, window_size, step_size, label):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Load accelerometer data from each file, apply sliding windows, and return windows and labels.\n","\n","    Parameters:\n","    ----------\n","    file_paths : list of str\n","        List of file paths to CSV files containing sensor data (with columns accel_x, accel_y, accel_z).\n","    window_size : int\n","        Number of time steps per sliding window.\n","    step_size : int\n","        Stride (step) between consecutive windows.\n","    label : int or str\n","        Activity label assigned to each window.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","    -------\n","    tuple (windows, labels)\n","        windows : np.ndarray\n","            3D array of shape (num_windows, window_size, 3)\n","            Each window contains accelerometer readings (x, y, z).\n","        labels : np.ndarray\n","            1D array of length num_windows containing the activity label for each window.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    windows = []\n","    labels = []\n","\n","    for file_path in file_paths:\n","        # Load only the accelerometer columns\n","        data = pd.read_csv(file_path, usecols=['accelX', 'accelY', 'accelZ'])\n","        data = data.to_numpy()\n","        num_samples = data.shape[0]\n","\n","        # Apply sliding windows\n","        for i in range(0, num_samples - window_size + 1, step_size):\n","            window = data[i:i + window_size]\n","            windows.append(window)\n","            labels.append(label)\n","\n","    return np.array(windows), np.array(labels)"],"metadata":{"id":"u3SuHww6MpEx","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1760433917012,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1,"user":{"displayName":"Passara Chanchotisatien","userId":"12057896095729141440"}}},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Load and Split Train Test for Each Activity Folder\n","\n","This function processes the sensor data for a specific activity, such as 'walking' or 'running', stored in its respective folder.
